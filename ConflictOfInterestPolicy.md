# Conflict Of Interest Statement

The Forward CloudSec Association (the "Association") has adopted a Conflict of
Interest policy (the "Policy") part of its bylaws. The Policy is aligned with
best practices for non-profit organizations that are tax exempt under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. These best practices and our bylaws
require that certain individuals affiliated with the Association sign a
statement annually affirming compliance with the Policy. This document serves
as that statement.
